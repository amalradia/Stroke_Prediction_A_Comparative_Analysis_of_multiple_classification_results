This study focuses on predicting and preventing strokes using machine learning techniques in healthcare settings. Leveraging the "Stroke Prediction Dataset" from Kaggle, the research explores classification algorithms (k Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression) in Python and Azure Machine Learning Designer. The aim is to enhance accuracy and interpretability of stroke prediction models.

Dataset
The dataset includes features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking status. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves preprocessing steps like handling missing values, converting categorical to numerical, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Classification Algorithms in Python
k Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Utilized for its ability to identify patterns and relationships in healthcare data. Effective in scenarios with unknown data distributions.
Decision Trees: Known for interpretability, useful in uncovering relationships within healthcare data.
Random Forests: Addresses Decision Trees' limitations, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
Logistic Regression: Chosen for simplicity, interpretability, and established theoretical foundation.
Results
Python Classification Models
Decision Tree:
High accuracy in predicting instances without strokes (class 0).
Struggles in predicting strokes (class 1) due to imbalance.
KNN:
83% overall accuracy.
Imbalance affects prediction of stroke cases (class 1).
Azure Machine Learning Designer
Two Class Decision Forest:
High overall correctness but struggles with precision and recall for predicting strokes.
Multiclass Logistic Regression:
Good overall accuracy but lower precision across classes.
Ethical Considerations
Class Imbalance: Imbalanced data impacts predictions, potentially leading to biases and health disparities.
Interpretability: Transparency and interpretability are crucial for healthcare professionals to trust and understand model decisions.
Privacy and Consent: Adhering to privacy standards and obtaining informed consent are essential in developing ethically sound healthcare applications.
Conclusion
While machine learning algorithms show potential in healthcare, ethical considerations such as class imbalance, interpretability, and privacy standards must be addressed. Achieving a balance between progress and ethical responsibility is crucial to prioritize patient well-being and foster trust in healthcare technology. All four classification algorithms should be approached cautiously on this dataset based on the results.
